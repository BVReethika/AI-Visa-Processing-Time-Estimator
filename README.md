# AI Enabled Visa Status Prediction and Processing Time Estimator

## Milestone 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing

### Objective
To create a clean and structured dataset for predicting visa processing time.

### Tasks Completed
- Created synthetic visa application dataset
- Handled missing decision dates
- Converted date formats
- Generated target variable (processing time in days)

### Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub

### Output
Processed dataset stored in:
data/processed/visa_cleaned_data.csv

# AI-Visa-Processing-Time-Estimator
This project aims to reduce uncertainty faced by visa applicants by improving transparency and enhancing the overall applicant experience. It follows a complete AI workflow including data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, making it suitable for academic, research, and demonstration purposes.


## Milestone 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Objective
To analyze the cleaned visa dataset and identify trends, patterns, and key factors affecting visa processing time.

### Tasks Completed
- Visualized distribution of visa processing time
- Compared processing times across visa types
- Analyzed processing times by applicant country
- Identified seasonal trends in visa applications
- Examined workload differences across processing centers
- Performed feature importance analysis using Random Forest

### Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub

### Output
- Multiple visualization plots generated using src/eda.py
- Feature importance values printed to console
- Insights used to guide machine learning model selection
